# UnlimitedRockCaches
A simple TLD (The Long Dark) mod to remove the limitation on how many Rock Caches you can place in a region.

* Allow up to 999 rock caches per region (uncertain on performance hit)
* Rock caches can now be built right next to each other.

## Requirements
This mod has only been tested on MelonLoader 0.6.0 with TLD version 2.05
(very likely it won't work on lower versions of either)


## Thanks
Thank you to all the helpful devs in the [TLD Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/EhBWKRx) for their patience and help.
